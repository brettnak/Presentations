# Music Theory

## Most People think it's complicated
 - Mysterious
 - Difficult to Understand

## But it's not
 - Math
  - Gross.
 - Every rule of music is based on what sounds good
  - NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!
  - What sounds good is NOT based on the rules.
 - More like really basic adition
 - Hard to remember rules
 - Lots to memorize

## The basics
 - Twelve tones ( notes )
 - Octaves are separated
 - Scales
  - Mainly variations of the major scale
 - Modes
  - Variations on the major scale

## Intarvals
 - When we talk about music, we usually talk about notes and chords relative to each other, not in the absolute terms of note names like C, D, E, etc.
 - The distance between notes
 - Maseured by degree of the major or minor scale with some stupidity from history.
 - Root
 - Flat Second
  - Diminished Second
  - Minor Second ( Not actually related to the minor scale, but related to the Phrygian mode... )
  - Half Step
  - Semitone
 - Major Second
  - Whole Tone
 - Minor Third
 - Major Third
 - Perfect Fourth
  - Same in both Major, Minor, Phrygian, and Chromatic
 - Dminished Fifth / Augmented Fourth
  - Flat Fifth
  - Sharp Fourth
 - Perfect Fifth
  - Same in both Major, Minor, Phrygian, and Chromatic
 - Minor Sixth
  - Fun Fact: The minor sixth chord does not have a minor sixth in it.
 - Major Sixth
  - Diminished Seventh
 - Minor / Dominant Seventh
 - Major Seventh
 - Octave ( Perfect )
  - Same in both Major, Minor, Phrygian, and Chromatic
  - No one ever says Perfect Octave

## Arpeggios
 - Chord symbols indicate Arpeggios
 - Arpeggios are built by taking every other note in a scale.
 - 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13
 - For a strictly standard arpeggio, you would stop at the fifth
  - By convention
  - 1, 3, 5 | 1, 3, 5 | 1, 3, 5
 - In jazz, we often use arpeggios.
  - 1, 3, 5, 7 of the particlar scale and color indicated by the chord
  - Adding the 6th to chord sounds good when the 7th is not called for by the chord symbol
   - Does not change the "color" nearly as much as adding the 7th, but fills in the sound well

## Pentatonics
 - Where Arpeggios outline chords, Pentatonics outline scales
 - This is why we can add 6ths to our arpeggios without changing their color
 - We are stil outlining the same scale the chord indicates, but not adding much color

## Tonality
 - Described in Consonance vs Dissonance
 - Consonance
  - The sound is reasonable to listen to
 - Dissonance
  - The sounds is unpleasing and "wants" to resolve to a pleasing sound
 - Simple example sus2 and sus4 both want to move to the standard major
 - The dominant Fifth chord resolves to the Tonic

## Chords
 - Chords are arpeggios, with all notes played together
 - Dissonance vs Consonance
 - Dominant vs Subdominant vs Tonic
 - Parallel Major Scales give you a huge starting point in Jazz.
 - Substitutions are made based on levels of Dissonance and Direction.
 - Color Tones
  - 7, 9, 11, 13
 - Quality Tones
  - 3, 5
 - Older Styles
  - Don't care about 9, 11, or 13 ( Extended Chords )
   - Will simplify to 7th Equivilent
   - They are arpeggiated extensions of the 7th Chords
 - Modern Styles
  - Some tones are typically left out of extended chords
  - Not covered, but they sound zingier if you leave out certain tones
   - e.g. in an 11th chord, you typically leave out the 3rd

## Music
 - Typically arranged into building and resolving of dissonance
 - Examples
  - Rhythim Changes
   - 1, 6, 2d, 5d
  - Blues
   - 1d, 4d, 1d, 5d
   - More traveling forms
  - 1 m4, 5d
  - 2 5d 1
