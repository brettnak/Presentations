        %h1 Music Theory
        %h2 Most People think it's complicated
        %ul
          %li Mysterious
          %li Difficult to Understand

            Every rule of music is based on what sounds good
            %ul
              %li NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!
              %li What sounds good is NOT based on the rules.
          %li More like really basic addition
          %li Hard to remember rules
          %li Lots to memorize
      .step.slide{'data-x' => -1000, 'data-y' => -700   }
        %h2 The basics
        %ul
          %li Twelve tones ( notes )
          %li Octaves are separated
          %li
            Scales
            %ul
              %li Mainly variations of the major scale
          %li
            Modes

              %li Variations on the major scale

        %h2 Intarvals
        %ul
          %li When we talk about music, we usually talk about notes and chords relative to each other, not in the absolute terms of note names like C, D, E, etc.
          %li The distance between notes
          %li Measured by degree of the major or minor scale with some stupidity from history.

        %h2 Arpeggios
        %ul
          %li Chord symbols indicate Arpeggios
          %li Arpeggios are built by taking every other note in a scale.
          %li 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13
          %li
            For a strictly standard arpeggio, you would stop at the fifth
            %ul
              %li By convention
              %li 1, 3, 5 | 1, 3, 5 | 1, 3, 5
          %li
            In jazz, we often use arpeggios.
            %ul
              %li 1, 3, 5, 7 of the particlar scale and color indicated by the chord
              %li Adding the 6th to chord sounds good when the 7th is not called for by the chord symbol
              %li Does not change the "color" nearly as much as adding the 7th, but fills in the sound well
      .step.slide{'data-x' =>     0, 'data-y' =>  100   }
        %h2 Pentatonics
        %ul
          %li Where Arpeggios outline chords, Pentatonics outline scales
          %li This is why we can add 6ths to our arpeggios without changing their color
          %li We are stil outlining the same scale the chord indicates, but not adding much color
      .step.slide{'data-x' => -1000, 'data-y' =>  900   }
        %h2 Tonality
        %ul
          %li Described in Consonance vs Dissonance
          %li
            Consonance
            %ul
              %li The sound is reasonable to listen to
          %li
            Dissonance
            %ul
              %li The sounds is unpleasing and "wants" to resolve to a pleasing sound
          %li
            Simple example sus2 and sus4
            %ul
              %li both want to move to the standard major
          %li The dominant Fifth chord resolves to the Tonic
      .step.slide{'data-x' =>     0, 'data-y' =>  900   }
        %h2 Chords
        %ul
          %li Chords are arpeggios, with all notes played together
          %li Dissonance vs Consonance
          %li Dominant vs Subdominant vs Tonic
          %li Parallel Major Scales give you a huge starting point in Jazz.
          %li Substitutions can be made based on levels of Dissonance and Direction.

                %li Not covered, but they sound zingier if you leave out certain tones
                %li e.g. in an 11th chord, you typically leave out the 3rd
